# DSA Project
Python implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms with web interface for Linked List and Stack operations.

## Overview
This project provides a practical implementation of fundamental data structures (Linked List and Stack) using Python, featuring a web interface built with HTML. The project demonstrates both array-based and linked list-based implementations of Stack, along with a comprehensive Linked List implementation.

## Data Structures Implemented

### 1. Linked List (`LinkedList.py`)
- Single Linked List implementation with the following operations:
  - Insert at beginning
  - Insert at end
  - Insert at position
  - Delete from beginning
  - Delete from end
  - Delete from position
  - Display list
  - Search element

### 2. Stack
#### Array Implementation (`StackArray.py`)
- Stack implementation using Python list with operations:
  - Push
  - Pop
  - Peek/Top
  - Is Empty
  - Is Full
  - Display stack

#### Linked List Implementation (`StackLinkedList.py`)
- Stack implementation using Linked List with operations:
  - Push
  - Pop
  - Peek/Top
  - Is Empty
  - Display stack

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xvishnuprasad/DSA-Project.git
cd DSA-Project
```

2. Install Flask (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install flask
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## Features
- Interactive web interface for data structure operations
- Implementation of both array and linked list based stacks
- Complete linked list implementation with all basic operations
- Clean and user-friendly interface
- Educational tool for understanding data structures

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- HTML
- Basic CSS
